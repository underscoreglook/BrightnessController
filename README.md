# BrightnessController
Automatically sets your Windows machine's brightness to 3 different settings depending on if the sun is up, sun is down, or sun is transitioning.

It's basically like flux except it doesn't change the color, just the gamma (brightness).

Written using Visual Studio 2017. Uses .NET framework.

Used a bunch of tutorials to get this done.
